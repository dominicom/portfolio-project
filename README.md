#### Project Instructions

Student has to:
* Download the design mockup [file](resources/design-mockup-portfolio).
* Identify the various boxes and build in order to recreate this design.
* Write `HTML` and `CSS` files, continue to iterate until your work is representative of the design mockup.
* Take the time to personalize portfolio with custom colors, additional content and your own images.
* Validate `HTML` and `CSS` against the W3C's Validators.
_Note: the validators consider the following errors, whereas Udacity accepts these errors as acceptable:_
  - HTML5: **Bad value X-UA-Compatible for attribute http-equiv on element meta** when using the `X-UA-Compatible` meta tag.
  - CSS3: **Property _[some property here]_ is an unknown vendor extension** when using vendor prefixed properties (like `-moz-box-sizing`).
